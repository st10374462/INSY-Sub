- A table (look at a markdown cheatsheet if you don't know how to create one) with
  - Each members name
  - Each members student number
  - Each members role in the group project (frontend, backend, documentation, etc.)
- A brief introduction/overview of what the assignment tasked you with
- A "features" section, explaining what functionality the backend, and each portal provides
- A "security overview" section, explaining what attacks you are preventing against (refer to your part 1 document), and how you have protected against them in your part 2s and 3s.
- A changelog section, explaining the differences added between part 2 and 3, or any feedback implemented
- A reference list of any additional resources you used when coding your part 2 and 3 (whether it be best practices you reffered to, or coding segments you've used)
- A recorded video, walking me through your entire part 3 portal
